    "TensorFlow is a framework developed by Google which is designed mainly for machine learning tasks, especially neural networks. It highly abstracts the usage of models so that users only need to adjust several very necessary parameters and TensorFlow will care about all the mechanism and realization details underneath for you. It also opens low level structures and shaped model parts for users to use and flexibly assemble their own customized models. TensorFlow supports GPU mode as well and has libraries for many programming languages including Python, C++, Java and Go."

Specifically, when running at line 7, the variable \"a\" is assigned value 1, when running at line 12, the calculation of \"formula1(a,b)\" is computed and the variable \"x\" is assigned value 4. However in TensorFlow, all the calculation and value assignments will not be executed unless explicitly asked to. Otherwise only the calculation process will be formed, but values won't be passed in and calculation will not happen. Thus, I think a likely analog could be merging all the formulas into a big one and wait to be explicitly asked to do the computation.

For example categorical data and strings. In order to coping with those data types, more complicated steps are needed to build feature columns which are suitable of inputing into the machine learning model. That is because machine learning models can only compute upon numerical values. Please check [this short introduction](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/feature_columns) if you wonder how to change other data types into usable numerical representations."

    "Neural Network also performs well. But this dataset is relatively too small and thus not very suitable for solving with DNN. Neural Network will perform better if there is more data. And there are a lot more hyperparameters that we can tune on to make both the classifiers better, for example adjusting learning rate, increasing training steps and create polynomial features."
